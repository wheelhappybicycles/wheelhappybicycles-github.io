  Martha's Vineyard offers bikers many options for fun and safe rides. Bring the family around the island as you have the option to go from town to town on just your bikes! From our shop, you're already in the heart of downtown Edgartown and can take your bikes down the bike path to South Beach (3 miles), Jaws Bridge at State Beach (3 miles), Downtown Oak Bluffs (6 miles), and Downtown Vineyard Haven (8.5 miles).
